In the first few years of this new decade three trophies were added to the cabinet by José Mourinho's 
Real Madrid. The most notable was the 2011-12 Liga title, which they won with a record-breaking 100 points, 
the highest score achieved in the history of the championship at that stage, and 121 goals. They also beat 
Barcelona to clinch a Copa del Rey and a Supercopa de España.</p>

In June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti arrived at Real Madrid. The Italian won four trophies with the Whites, 
the first coming in the shape of Real Madrid's nineteenth Copa del Rey, after beating Barcelona 1-2 in 
the final. On 24 May 2014, Madrid lifted the European Cup once again, claiming La Décima with a 4-1 victory 
over Atlético in Lisbon. Goals from Ramos, Bale, Marcelo and Cristiano secured the triumph.</p>

Two further triumphs arrived in the second season under Ancelotti: The European Super Cup, against Sevilla 
and Real Madrid’s first World Club Cup, against San Lorenzo. This meant Real Madrid capped of a historic 
year in their history in 2014, making it the year in which most trophies were won by the club. In June 2015,
Rafa Benítez returned to the club where he cut his teeth, to take charge of the Whites. Then, in January 
2016, Zidane made the step up to first team coach, following his legendary career as a player. His first 
season ended with the team lifting the La Undécima trophy, against Atlético in Milán.</p>

The Frenchman's second season was one bursting with trophies. Real Madrid won La Duodécima, becoming the 
first team ever to retain the title in the Champions League era. Alongside Europe's elite competition, 
they also conquered LaLiga 2016-17, their third European Super Cup and second Club World Cup, played in 
Japan. The 2017-18 season kicked off by lifting another European Super Cup, overcoming Manchester United, 
and their tenth Spanish Super Cup. December 2017 then yielded another World Club Cup trophy, setting a new 
record of winning five titles in the same year.
